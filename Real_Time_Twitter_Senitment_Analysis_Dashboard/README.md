# 🧠 Real-Time Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dashboard

This project is a real-time Twitter sentiment analyzer built with **Streamlit**, **Tweepy**, and **Scikit-learn**. It fetches live tweets based on user input, processes the text using a trained NLP model, and visualizes the sentiments (Positive/Negative) interactively.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔎 Search live tweets by topic or hashtag
- 🧪 NLP-based sentiment prediction using LinearSVC + TF-IDF
- 📊 Real-time dashboard built with Streamlit
- 🗂️ Daily sentiment logs saved in CSV format
- 🔐 Environment-safe configuration using `.env` files

## 📂 Sentiment Logs

Each time tweets are analyzed, a log is created in `logs/sentiment_log.csv` with:

* Timestamp
* Tweet content
* Sentiment label (Positive/Negative)

---

## 🧠 Model Info

* **Vectorizer**: TF-IDF with bigrams
* **Model**: `LinearSVC` (trained on labeled Twitter data)
* Accuracy Achieved: **\~80.4%**

---

## 📡 API Use Case Description (For Twitter Developer Portal)

> This application uses Twitter’s API to fetch live tweets related to trending topics or user-defined queries. The fetched tweets are analyzed using a local NLP model to determine public sentiment (positive or negative). These results are displayed in a web dashboard and optionally logged for research and analysis purposes. No data is stored or shared externally.
